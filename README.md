Hello! Vatsal Bhuva here (TNINT0356).
This is a mini-project that I built to implement a count-down timer using Tkinter.
It has the following functionalities:
1) Set:
- Use this button to set the initial timer.
2) Start:
- Use this button to start the timer.
3) Stop:
- Use this button to stop the timer.
4) Reset:
- Use this button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.
